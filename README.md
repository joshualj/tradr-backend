# Tradr Backend

This repository contains the Java / Spring Boot backend for Tradr. It accepts a user-provided stock ticker and timeframe, makes API calls to retrieve fundamental and technical indicators, performs stock analysis, and calls separately-hosted prediction models to provide a user with a score based on the likelihood that the stock will outperform the S\&P 500 over the provided timeframe.
