# Tradr Backend

This repository contains the Java / Spring Boot backend for Tradr. It accepts a user-provided stock ticker and timeframe, makes API calls to retrieve fundamental and technical indicators, performs stock analysis, and calls a separately-hosted prediction model to produce a score based on the likelihood that the stock will outperform the S&P 500 over the provided timeframe.
